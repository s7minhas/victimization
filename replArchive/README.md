## Replication instructions for the paper

Please note that some of the underlying data files, such as raw ACLED data, cannot be shared.

The base directory of the replication archive contains all the figures and tables shown in the paper. There are three  subdirectories that contain the code necessary to produce these outputs (note that these files are also available on Github at [https://github/s7minhas/victimization](https://github.com/s7minhas/victimization)):

- **compModelSim**: contains the code necessary for running the computational model, organizing the results, and conducting the regression analysis
- **acledAnalysis**: contains the code necessary for running the empirical analysis in the paper
- **appendix**: contains the code necessary to reproduce all the figures in the Appendix
- **graphics**: contains .pngs and .tex files for all the figures and tables in the manuscript and appendix
- **data**: contains the data files used in the analysis
- **results**: contains the results of model runs
- **funcs**: contains a set of R scripts with helper functions used in the analysis

Replicating the figures and tables in the **main** text will take only a few minutes on a standard laptop if the provided `.rda` files are used.

#### Reproducing figures in the manuscript

The `here` package is used to manage paths in this replication archive for R scripts. The .here file is stored in the top-most folder of the replication archive. Scripts are listed in order of the figures and tables in the manuscript. For python related scripts, the path will need to be set manually in one file: `compModelSim/abmRunning.py`.

- **figure_1.R**: Creates the hypothetical network used to show scenarios of low and high network competition. No inputs necessary. Output is stored in `graphics/figure1.png`.
- Figures 2 and 3 are constructed manually and are not based on any code.
- Table 1 is constructed manually. The parameter listed in that table accord with the simulation parameters used in `compModelSim/abmRunning.py`.
- **figure_4.R**: Summarizes the results of a regression analysis on the simulated data. The `figure_4.R` script just create a coefficient plot using two inputs: `results/abm_feCoefs.rda` and `results/abm_reCoefs.rda`. The output of this script is stored in `graphics/figure4.png`. Steps to reproduce these results from scratch involve running the computational model, processing the data, and conducting the regression analysis; each of the scripts necessary to perform these steps are in the `compModelSim` directory:
  - `1_abmRunning.py`: Runs the computational model using the parameters specified in the paper, the code for the model itself is located in `0_VicForViz.py` (This file takes several hours to run).
  - `2_getVicCount.R`: Calculates victimization counts from the game.
  - `3_getNetStats.R`: Calculates network statistics from the game (This file utilizes parallelization, adjust number of cores in the script).
  - `4_abmDataPrep.R`: Organizing the data for analysis.
  - `5_fe_abmAnalysis.R`: Runs the fixed effects regression analysis (This file takes several hours to run).
  - `5_re_abmAnalysis.R`: Runs the random effects regression analysis.
- **figure_5.R**: Creates a descriptive visualization of how the number of actors in armed conflicts have changed over time as well as our key independent variable, network competition. The inputs for this script are: `data/rawModelData.rda` and `data/actorCntsID.rda`. The output of this script is stored in `graphics/figure5.png`.
- Table 2 is constructed manually.
- **figure_6_7.R**: Summarizes the results of a regression analysis on data from ACLED. The script requires three inputs: `results/baseMods.rda`, `results/cnt1Mods.rda`, and `results/cnt2Mods.rda`. The output of this script is stored in `graphics/figure6.png` and `graphics/figure7.png`. Steps to reproduce these results from scratch involve imputing data, running base model, running model with first set of controls, and running model with second set of controls; each of the scripts necessary to perform these steps are in the `acledAnalysis` directory:
  - `1_genImpData.R`: Performs multiple imputation analysis.
  - `2a_runModels_base.R`: Runs models without any controls not being measured from ACLED.
  - `2b_runModels_cnt1.R`: Runs models with first set of controls specified in the manuscript.
  - `2c_runMOdels_cnt2.R`: Runs models with second set of controls specified in the manuscript.
- **figure8.R**: Performs a simulation analysis to estimate the substantive effect of network competition across the model results presented in the manuscript. The script requires three inputs: `results/baseMods.rda`, `results/cnt1Mods.rda`, and `results/cnt2Mods.rda`. The output of this script is stored in `graphics/figure8.png`. The inputs for this script should have already been generated when following the steps laid out for `figure_6_7.R`.

#### R package build notes

Below we provide the version of each of the libraries that our project relies on (each library was built using R 4.0.5). We use one package, `simHelper`, that is not available on CRAN and needs to be installed using devtools, this can be done via executing the following R code: `devtools::install_github('s7minhas/simHelper', ref='vic')`. Version information for the other libraries used in the analysis are shown below:

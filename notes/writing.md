CD REVISIONS FOR VIC

## Framing

*Done*
- Reorganized according to Larson/Scott
- Said upfront that the article provides a principal way of doing vic stuff
- included anecodtes and actCnts graphic into interpretation
- moved key finding clearly into introduction
- emphasized the 'choice to victimize'(larson)
- we edited ABM section with updates wanted by reviews
- small edits to conclusion
- added new citations throughout
-

*To Do*
- we need more cites/perhaps further edits on the 'two camps' of competitng mechanisms regarding vic and muilti party civil wars
- is there a way to move up hypothesis section? Suggestion by larson. After my rewrites I was not sure about this.
- epsilon
- make sure all numbers/empirics are current with updated data
- do we want to add anecdotes (see CD ideas in MS) to the stylized nets section?
- add more women authors if justified / fits
- do we want to call it an ABM? computational model? be consistent or mix it up?
- any policy implications?
- equations sometimes have "*" for multiplication and sometimes do not

empirical results hold with fixed or random effects on countries

to maximimize the amount of data we have for every model we break our models with controls into two pieces, the first includes polity, world bank vars, and excl pop. the max year for this dataset is 2018 because of epr sample limitations. the other adds in kathman's peacekeeper variable and rebel v gov strength from gleditsch's nsa dataset. max year for this is 2012 because of nsa limitations.
